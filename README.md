# Transmission Dynamic Model Demo

This is a demo version of a disease transmission dynamic model written in MATLAB. A basic version of simulation model can be shared on reasonable request to the contributors.

## How to run
Just run the `TransmissionDynamic_Model_Demo.m` script on MATLAB and follow the questions in the command window to set up the simulation parameters. No need to change any parameters in the script. 

## Example
A short video, `Example_1000p_recover.mp4`, demonstrated an example run of this demo version.
